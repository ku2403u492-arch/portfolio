    overview: "The Thanvi typeface is a contemporary sans-serif font family designed and developed using FontLab. Created as a personal typographic exploration, the font reflects clarity, versatility, and structural precision. The family includes multiple weights and styles—Extra Light, Light, Regular, Bold, Black, Italic, Bold Italic, Condensed, and Expanded—making it adaptable across print and digital applications. The design emphasizes legibility while maintaining a clean, modern aesthetic suitable for branding and editorial contexts.",
    concept: "The concept behind Thanvi was to design a typeface that balances minimalism with flexibility. Inspired by modern geometric forms and systematic typography, the letterforms are constructed with consistent stroke modulation and balanced proportions. The variations in width (Condensed and Expanded) and weight allow the typeface to function as a complete visual communication system rather than a single style. Naming the font after myself transforms it into an extension of my design identity—strong, adaptable, and structured yet expressive.",

The typeface performs effectively across different weights without losing its character, ensuring readability and visual harmony. This project strengthened my knowledge of type anatomy, kerning, and font production workflows in FontLab. Thanvi stands as both a personal branding element and a professional exploration into type design within communication design practice.",
